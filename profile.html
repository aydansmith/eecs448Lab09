        <h1>Biography of Stella Hayes</h1>
        <p class="bio">Stella Hayes is both a pup and an old lady. She is both filled with energy and occassionally with disdain. She will kiss you and then growl at you. As Katy Perry would say, she's hot then she's cold. Though, through it all, she is far and away the best pup to ever walk the face of this Earth.</p>
